content of the gameFile:
each gameFile start with the game name
following this is a list of players
the order of the players is their order around the table
I will call all this information the header
after the header is the body, this will vary between games

the gameFile body in hearts:
in hearts the body will first by empty
if the body is empty the master will write a deal to the gameFile
a deal is a permutation of the numbers 00,01...51
(00=2hearts,01=3hearts...13=2spades...)
notice all numbers are padded to take up 2 chars
all players can then read this and determine their hand
(first player takes first 13 cards, second takes second 13 etc)
after this all cards played by a player are appended to the body
eg: gameFile = (header goes here) (deal goes here) 39514243
this means the cards played were 39,51,42,43 = 2clubs,aceClubs,5clubs,6clubs
this continues until all cards are played
by examining the body, it can be determined whose turn it is
if hearts have broken (and therefore if one can play hearts)
what the suit is (and therefore what suit one can play)
and how many points each player has

Here is a simplified version of the above

simple hearts (no swap at start of round)
1: master writes deal (a permutation of 00,01...51)
2: each player determines if it is their turn and writes and a card if it is
3: repeat 2 until no cards left
4: repeat 1 through 3 until 100 points reached (or some number other than 100)

for the swap, there needs to be a "swap ID" that tells the player what direction
the swap will go, 0=no swap, 1=cw, 2=ccw, 3=across

hearts with swap:
1: master writes deal followed by a swap ID
2: each player writes the 3 cards they want to swap when it is there turn
3: each player determines if it is their turn and writes and a card if it is
4: repeat 3 until no cards left
5: repeat 1 through 4 until 100 points reached
